20% - README.txt or README.md explains what the program is, and how to run it.

20% - Student added some material (puzzle, choices, or feature) other than suggested by the original assignments.

40% - Overall functionality and clarity of program.


====================== AI PROMPTS: GPT-4o mini ======================

Bot 1: Timer Bot
Prompt 1: "I'm making an escape room game in C++, please give me some puzzle ideas I could use for it in levels of increasing difficulty for the player."
Prompt 2: "How do I put in a timer feature for my C++ game that will lead them to a game over if they fail to reach the end in time? This will all be text."
Prompt 3: "Can you remake this, but with "using namespace std" in it?"
Prompt 4: "Can you make it so the timer starts when the player enters into a specific room (the different rooms are different void functions)."
Prompt 5: "I don't fully understand the part where the timer starts when a player enters a room. Could you explain that more? Also, will the timer continue to go as the player advances through each room? If not, please add that in to the code."
Prompt 6: "It says that "timerThread" was not declared. What do I do?"
Prompt 7: "When starting the escape room game, it pops up a line that says "Room 1emaining: 300 seconds". How do I get rid of that and just keep the count down timer?"
Prompt 8: "The timer shows a frozen line that says "Time remaining: 300 seconds", also the cursor is stuck on the count down timer under it, so I can't do the puzzle for the first room. How can I have it so only the count down timer shows up at the top and I can interact with the puzzle"
Prompt 9: "When I start the escape room, the count down timer is at the top; however, my cursor is still stuck in the timer and gives me an error when I try to move to the next room. How do I fix this? My code: *Copy and pastes code*"

Bot 2: Puzzle Bot
Prompt 1: "How do I code a logic grid puzzle for an escape room in C++"
Prompt 2: "I got this error: "redefinition of ‘void LogicGrid::applyClue(const std::string&)’" What do I do?"
Prompt 3: "What are some pretty simple puzzles (with examples) I can put for my escape room that's all C++"
Prompt 4: "Now, give me 5 more puzzles, but bump up the difficulty"
Prompt 5: "I need 2 more examples"
Prompt 6: "Now, give me another 5 puzzles, but bump up the difficulty even more"
Prompt 7: "How can I build a small minesweeper puzzle in C++?"
Prompt 8: "Can I have a puzzle that tells a random riddle each time?"
Prompt 9: "Can you give me other puzzle ideas that are medium difficulty?"
Prompt 10: "How do I make a codebreaker morse code escape room, but make the words random?"
Prompt 11: "The morse code puzzle in my code immediately displays the "Incorrect. The original word was: " with the answer once it starts. How do I fix this? Code: *Copy and prints code*"
Prompt 12: "Can you point out specifically what areas in my code need to be adjusted?"
Prompt 13: "That's the same code I have, besides it going to the next puzzle. How do I fix this?"
