:: // === AI ASSISTANCE DOCUMENTATION === {"position":"25,25","size":"100,100"}
// LLM Used: GPT-4o mini created by OpenAI
//
// PROMPT 1:
// Hi!
// I have C++ code that I would like turned into a .twee format. Each decision point must become its own passage with
// appropriate links.
// Here is the code: [Copy and pasted C++ code]
//
// RESULT: The GPT bot proceeded to turn the C++ code into a .twee format; however, it stopped at :: DoorTwo.
//
// PROMPT 2:
// Please include the rest of the code after :: DoorTwo
//
// RESULT: The GPT bot redid all of the twine code, but left out the game over section.
//
// PROMPT 3:
// Please include the game over section
//
// RESULT: The GPT bot redid all of the twine code for a second time. All the code was converted to a .twine format.
//
// PROMPT 4: 
// Hey, it says there is no starting point set for the story. Can you fix that?
//
// RESULT: The bot sent all the same code from prompt 3.
//
// PROMPT 5:
// The lines for ":: Bedroom" is wrong, can you fix that?
//
// RESULT: The bot sent all the same code again, but the lines in the ":: Bedroom" section were not fixed.
//
// PROMPT 6:
// No, still wrong. Just give me the section for the bedroom
//
// RESULT: The bot sent only the ":: Bedroom" section, but the lines still weren't fixed.
//
// PROMPT 7:
// No, the lines are still wrong, please correct it
//
// RESULT: The bot sent only the ":: Bedroom" section, but the lines were correct this time.
//
// MANUAL FIXES:
// - Manually put where the starting point is in the story:
//      The code the bot sent was the same code as before. I figured the bot wouldn't be as much help, so I did it myself.
// - Manually put in (copy and pasted) the new lines for the ":: Bedroom" section:
//      I just didn't want to have to get the bot to write so much code again, much quicker to do it myself.

=== REFLECTION ON PROMPT WRITING ===

What made a good prompt?
A good prompt is a prompt that is specific about the goal the user wants to achieve. The user will make sure to give the AI as much information as possible in order for the bot to understand what it is supposed to do.

What made a bad prompt?
A bad prompt is a prompt that is unclear. Users that give little to no useful information on what the user wants will have bad results from AI.

What did I learn about working with AI assistants?
I learned that AI assistants are helpful in speeding up tedious tasks. However, AI assistants are also prone to error if given big tasks and not much information.

If I did this again, I would...
I would break up what I want from the AI into sections (such as having the AI convert one section of my C++ code into Twine, then onto the next). I also, if something needs to be fixed, give more information I would need to the AI to ensure the results are right the first time (so for the ":: Bedroom" issue, I'd provide the lines to the bot).


:: Start {"position":"200,25","size":"100,100"}
You break into a house that you've been keeping an eye on for weeks now.  
You heard that this house holds a safe with $500,000 in it.  
You only have enough time to explore one room.  
Which room do you choose to navigate into?
